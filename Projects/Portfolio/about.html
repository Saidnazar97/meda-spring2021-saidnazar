          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I have studied economics but have always been interested in web
            development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page with
            HTML and CSS. While I was studying in the university I took computer
            science as my minor subject and was introduced to programming.
            During my studies I was an active member in student associations and
            became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including
            being a web master. That and my previous interest in web development
            created a spark to turn my hobby into a career. I took my first
            steps towards my new role in January 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a
            member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with
            changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high
            precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting
            "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming
            or designing.
