                I am a 23 year old finish web developer with science and

                located in central Asia. On my free time, I like trying new
                ice-cream places and long drives to amazing natural places.

              <h3>More About Me</h3>
              <p>
                I have studied economics but have always been interested in web
                development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page
                with HTML and CSS. While I was studying in the university I took
                computer science as my minor subject and was introduced to
                programming. During my studies I was an active member in student
                associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and
                projects including being a web master. That and my previous
                interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby
                into a career. I took my first steps towards my new role in
                January 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as
                a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with
                changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but
                high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for
                getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like
                programming or designing.
