ABOUT ME.
 I have studied economics but have always been interested in web
                development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page
                with HTML and CSS. While I was studying in the university I took
                computer science as my minor subject and was introduced to
                programming. During my studies I was an active member in student
                associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and
                projects including being a web master. That and my previous
                interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby
                into a career. I took my first steps towards my new role in
                January 2019.
